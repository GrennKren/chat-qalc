# Chat Qalc (Forked)

This is a fork of [chat-qalc](https://github.com/vlad2305m/chat-qalc).

## Changes in This Fork

I used the [FabricMC template](https://fabricmc.net/develop/template) as a base and made only minor modifications for 1.21.4:

- Updated dependency versions to match the latest environment.
- Added two small fixes to ensure it runs properly.

However, since I'm not a modder, I can't guarantee the stability of this mod.

## How to Use

1. **Download the portable version of Qalculate** from the [official Qalculate website](https://qalculate.github.io/downloads.html).
2. Extract the downloaded file in the following directory:
   ```
   ./minecraft/config/chatqalc/
   ```

After that, the mod should work as intended.
